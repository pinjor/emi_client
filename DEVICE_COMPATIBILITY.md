## üîç How to Test New Devices

### Step 1: Try QR Code First
1. Factory reset device
2. Generate QR code with correct checksum
3. Scan QR during setup
4. **If it works:** Add to "QR Code Works" list
5. **If it fails immediately:** Add to "QR Code Blocked" list

### Step 2: Use ADB as Fallback
If QR fails, use ADB provisioning:
```bash
# Windows
.\setup_gigax_y10.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./setup_gigax_y10.sh
```

### Step 3: Update This Document
Add the device to the appropriate category with:
- Brand
- Model
- Android version
- Test result
- Any special notes

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Deployment

1. **Stock Android Devices (Pixel, Nokia, Motorola)**
   - ‚úÖ Use QR code provisioning
   - Fast and reliable

2. **Chinese OEM Devices (GIGAX, Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi)**
   - ‚ùå Don't attempt QR code
   - Use ADB provisioning directly
   - Saves time and frustration

3. **Samsung Devices**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Try QR code first
   - If fails, use ADB
   - OneUI 6 (Android 14) has mixed results

4. **Unknown Devices**
   - Try QR code first
   - Have ADB setup ready as backup
   - Document results for future reference

## üîß Why Some Devices Block QR Provisioning

### OEM Restrictions
Many manufacturers (especially Chinese OEMs) block QR provisioning to:
1. Force use of their own MDM solutions
2. Prevent enterprise deployment of third-party apps
3. Maintain control over device management
4. Promote their own business services

### Android 14 Changes
Android 14 introduced stricter provisioning validation:
1. Enhanced security checks
2. OEM-level provisioning controls
3. More restrictive default policies
4. Better protection against malicious provisioning

### Technical Reasons
Some devices block QR provisioning due to:
1. Custom Android builds (MIUI, ColorOS, FunTouch)
2. Carrier restrictions
3. Regional variants
4. Enterprise-specific builds

## üí° Best Practices

### For Sellers/Technicians

1. **Check Device Compatibility First**
   - Look up device in this document
   - Know which method to use before starting

2. **Have Both Methods Ready**
   - QR code printed/displayed
   - PC with ADB installed
   - USB cables available

3. **Document New Devices**
   - Test and record results
   - Update this document
   - Share findings with team

4. **Optimize Workflow**
   - Group devices by provisioning method
   - Do all QR devices first (faster)
   - Do all ADB devices together (need PC)

### For Developers

1. **Keep Both Methods Updated**
   - Maintain QR code format
   - Keep ADB scripts working
   - Test on new Android versions

2. **Monitor Success Rates**
   - Track which devices fail QR
   - Update compatibility list
   - Improve error messages

3. **Consider Alternatives**
   - NFC provisioning (Android 10+)
   - Zero-touch enrollment (enterprise)
   - Custom OEM partnerships

## üöÄ Future Improvements

### Planned Features

1. **Auto-Detection**
   - Admin app detects device model
   - Suggests best provisioning method
   - Shows device-specific instructions

2. **Hybrid Provisioning**
   - Try QR code first
   - Auto-fallback to ADB if fails
   - Seamless user experience

3. **Wireless ADB**
   - After initial setup
   - No USB cable needed
   - Faster bulk provisioning

4. **OEM Partnerships**
   - Work with GIGAX/Vivo/Oppo
   - Get app whitelisted
   - Enable QR provisioning

## üìû Reporting Issues

### If QR Code Fails on a Device

Please report with:
1. Device brand and model
2. Android version
3. When error appears (immediate/after download/after install)
4. Error message (if any)
5. Whether ADB method worked
