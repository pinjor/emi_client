# üì± GIGAX Y10 Setup Guide - ADB Provisioning

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why ADB Instead of QR Code?

**GIGAX Y10 (Android 14) blocks factory reset QR provisioning.** This is an OEM restriction, not a bug in our app.

The error "Can't set up device" appearing **immediately after scanning the QR code** (before download even starts) confirms the device blocks QR provisioning at the system level.

**Solution: Use ADB provisioning instead.** This method:
- ‚úÖ Works on ALL Android devices (including GIGAX Y10)
- ‚úÖ Bypasses OEM restrictions completely
- ‚úÖ Is the official Google-recommended workaround
- ‚úÖ Takes only 2-3 minutes per device

---

## üéØ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Prepare Device
1. Factory reset the GIGAX Y10
2. **Skip ALL setup steps** (no Google account, no OEM account)
3. Connect to WiFi (needed for app registration later)
4. Enable Developer Options:
   - Go to: **Settings ‚Üí About phone**
   - Tap **"Build number"** 7 times
   - You'll see: "You are now a developer!"
5. Enable USB Debugging:
   - Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Developer options**
   - Enable **"USB debugging"**
   - Confirm the prompt

### Step 2: Connect to Computer
1. Connect device to PC via USB cable
2. On device, tap **"Allow USB debugging"** when prompted
3. Check **"Always allow from this computer"**
4. Tap **"OK"**

### Step 3: Run Provisioning Script

**On Windows:**
```powershell
cd "W:\D_folder\emi client\emi_client"
.\setup_gigax_y10.ps1
```

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
cd /path/to/emi_client
chmod +x setup_gigax_y10.sh
./setup_gigax_y10.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check ADB connection
2. ‚úÖ Install the EMI Locker APK
3. ‚úÖ Set the app as Device Owner
4. ‚úÖ Verify success

**Total time: 2-3 minutes per device**

## üìû Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why doesn't QR code work on GIGAX Y10?**
A: GIGAX Y10 (likely a Vivo/Oppo variant) blocks QR provisioning at the OEM level. This is intentional by the manufacturer. ADB is the official workaround.

**Q: Is ADB provisioning secure?**
A: Yes! It's the official Google-recommended method for OEM-blocked devices. The app still becomes Device Owner with full security.

**Q: Can we use QR on other devices?**
A: Yes! QR works on:
- Google Pixel
- Motorola
- Nokia
- OnePlus
- Most stock Android devices

Use ADB only for GIGAX Y10 and other blocked devices.

**Q: Do we need PC for every device?**
A: Only for GIGAX Y10 and similar OEM-blocked devices. Other devices can use QR code provisioning.

**Q: Can we automate this further?**
A: Yes! You can:
- Create a batch script for multiple devices
- Use wireless ADB (after initial setup)
- Build a custom provisioning tool
